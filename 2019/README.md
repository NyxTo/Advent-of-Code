# AoC 2019

This year I'll try and pick up some [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). It's based on C++ (which I'm currently already quite familiar with), similar in speed/performance, but with a lot more safety nets in terms of type checking/inference, memory allocation/freeing, and error handling. It also works well with JavaScript (which I also know well) on the web, though that's not necessary for this AoC.

I'm new to the language, so I realise my solutions may not be the "neatest" or the most "idiomatic" code. Find the puzzles at https://adventofcode.com/2019.
