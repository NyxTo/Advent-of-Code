# AOC 2019

This year I'll try and pick up some [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). It's basically C++ (which I'm currently already quite familiar with) with a lot more safety nets in terms of type checking/inference, memory allocation/freeing, and error handling. It also works well with JavaScript (which I also know well) on the web, to improve performance speed, though that's not necessary for this AOC.
