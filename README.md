# Advent-of-Code

This is just a record of my progress and solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/about) puzzles. From the About page:

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

I'll try to pick up the basics/fundamentals of a new programming language each year I try these puzzles!
