My previous try at AOC 2019 had code that was quite messy and bodged together. Now that I'm (hopefully) a little more familiar with the Rust language, this is my attempt to create neater and more idiomatic code. Hope this goes according to plan!

I'll replace the original 2019 directory with this one when it's done.
