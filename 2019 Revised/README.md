My previous try at AOC 2019 had code that was quite messy and bodged together. Now that I'm (hopefully) a little more familiar with the Rust language, this is my attempt to create neater and more idiomatic code. Hope this goes according to plan!

I'll also breaking down and analysing the `Intcode` puzzle inputs manually, although partly code-assisted, and uploading the code I used to process it (also in Rust)!

I'll replace the original 2019 directory with this one when it's done.
